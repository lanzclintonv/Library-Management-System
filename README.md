Project Title: Library Management System with Java GUI

Project Description:

This project is a library management system that allows librarians to manage books and students to borrow books from a library. The system is built using Java programming language and has a functional GUI for easy navigation and use. The system allows librarians to add, edit, and delete books from the library collection.

For borrowing, students can use the system to search for books based on the book title, author, or ISBN. The system allows students to borrow books for a specified time, after which the book will automatically be marked as returned.

The data for the library management system is stored in a txt file rather than using SQL for data retention. The stored data is manipulated and saved using string manipulations. The system is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, with fast search and retrieval of book information.
